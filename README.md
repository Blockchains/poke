Poke is a CLI tool for interacting with smart contracts.

# Installation

The easiest way to get started is to [download the latest binary release](https://dl.equinox.io/reserve/poke/stable).

If you prefer, you can also install poke from source. You'll need Go 1.12+, with modules enabled (eg `GO111MODULE=on`):

    go get github.com/reserve-protocol/poke
