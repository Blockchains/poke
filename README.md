Poke is a CLI tool for interacting with smart contracts.

# Installation

The easiest way to get started is to [download the latest binary release](https://dl.equinox.io/reserve-protocol/poke/stable).

If you prefer, you can also install poke from source. You'll need [Go 1.12+](https://golang.org/dl/), with modules enabled (eg `GO111MODULE=on`). Just clone this repo locally and run `go install` in the repo root:

    git clone https://github.com/reserve-protocol/poke.git
    cd poke
    go install
